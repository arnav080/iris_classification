# Iris Flower Classification

#### Problem Statement
This data set consists of the physical parameters of three species of flower â€” Versicolor, Setosa and Virginica. The numeric parameters which the dataset contains are Sepal width, Sepal length, Petal width and Petal length. In this data we will be predicting the classes of the flowers based on these parameters.The data consists of continuous numeric values which describe the dimensions of the respective features. We will be training the model based on these features.

#### Objective
The aim of this project is to build a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of iris flowers and accurately classify them into their respective species. The main objective is to automate the classification process by leveraging the unique features of each iris species.

#### Key Project Details:

- Iris flowers have three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
- These species can be distinguished based on measurements such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
- The project involves training a machine learning model on a dataset that contains iris flower measurements associated with their respective species.
- The trained model will classify iris flowers into one of the three species based on their measurements.
